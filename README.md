# SAP ABAP - SWO key fields as SALV in dynpro
This report is a proof of concept that it is possible to output SWO key fields as SALV. Any SAP business can be specified in the screen, from which the 'field catalogue' is dynamically generated. For testing, it is also possible to specify up to 3 object keys which are then mapped into the SALV.
