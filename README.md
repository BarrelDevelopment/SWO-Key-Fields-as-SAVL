# swo_keys_as_salv
This report is a proof of concept that it is possible to output SWO key fields as SALV. Any SAP business can be specified in the screen, from which the 'field catalogue' is dynamically generated. It is also possible to specify up to 3 object keys which are then mapped into the SALV.
